Note: The final submission in Quadcopter Control Systems was a group project worked on by 4 students of which I was one. The class it was a part of laid out all of the individual components of the system as weekly assignments. Therefore, while I did in fact write and implement all of the components at least once, the final assembly was a team effort that at this point is quite difficult to tell who did what on.
